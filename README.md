# JS-Resume

Static website with my Resum√© based one of the projects in Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program and completely rewritten with a basic MVC pattern in Vanilla Javascript using ES6, Webpack, Babel, Autoprefixer, SCSS and of course HTML5.

The object was to practice ES6 syntac and MVC pattern and modular build and showcase some of my current knowledge in front-end development.

Original project's repository can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume
